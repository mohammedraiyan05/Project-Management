#### Key Components:
- **Total Tasks** – Represents the overall workload across all projects.
- **Completed Tasks** – Indicates the number of tasks successfully completed.
- **Task Completion Rate (%)** – Measures operational efficiency by comparing completed tasks to total tasks.
- **SLA Compliance (%)** – Shows the percentage of tasks completed within the planned timeline.
- **Delayed Tasks** – Highlights tasks that missed deadlines, indicating operational risk.

#### Supporting Visuals:
- **Task Trend Over Time** – Displays task volume trends to identify workload patterns.
- **Task Status Distribution** – Shows the proportion of tasks by status (Completed, In Progress, Pending).
- **Delay Analysis** – Compares delayed vs on-time tasks.
- **Operational Task Breakdown** – Provides detailed task-level information for deeper analysis.

#### Key Components:
- **Total Employees** – Displays the number of employees involved in operations.
- **Average Tasks per Employee** – Measures workload distribution across employees.
- **Delayed Tasks** – Highlights operational delays impacting productivity.
- **Average Planned Duration** – Indicates average task duration to assess process efficiency.

#### Supporting Visuals:
- **Employee Productivity Analysis** – Compares task volume across employees to identify workload imbalance.
- **Projects with Highest Delays** – Highlights projects contributing most to operational delays.
- **Priority vs Task Status** – Shows risk exposure by comparing task priority with execution status.
- **Delayed Task Details Table** – Lists delayed tasks with project, priority, and employee details for action planning.
